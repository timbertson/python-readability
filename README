This is a python port of a ruby port of arc90's readability project

http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/

Given a html document, it pulls out the main body text and cleans it up.

Ruby port by starrhorne and iterationlabs
Python port by gfxmonk

This port uses BeautifulSoup for the HTML parsing. That means it can be
a little slow, but will work on Google App Engine (unlike libxml-based
libraries)
